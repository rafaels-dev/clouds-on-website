I was born with a keyboard in my hands — I wrote my first line of code at age 6 on a Dynacom PC95. Since then, technology has become my life, spanning from hardware to programming, local networks, and more recently, distributed and cloud computing.

I started working very young, focused on maintenance and development, which allowed me to build a solid foundation in different areas of computing. Over time, I became a T-Shaped professional, passionate about understanding everything involving technology from end to end — from infrastructure to software. Throughout my career, I've worked in various technical and leadership roles, accumulating experience in distributed systems, DevSecOps, SRE, and working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Currently, I'm a Software Technical Leader at Mercado Libre, where I lead teams dedicated to platform engineering, focusing on automation, regulatory compliance, and high availability of distributed services. Additionally, I dedicate time to personal projects, developing practical, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, always with a focus on innovation combined with technical efficiency.

My passion for the cloud materialized with the popularization of virtualization and cloud services, which allowed me to overcome physical limitations and create sophisticated distributed environments with flexibility and scalability. With this blog, I seek to share my knowledge and experience, bringing the perspective of a programmer who deeply understands infrastructure — to help professionals, enthusiasts, and organizations navigate the vast ecosystem of cloud computing.
